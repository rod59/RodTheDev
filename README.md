# RodTheDev
This is a fun little project I did in my free time to showcase the beauty that can be achived with pure html, css, and javascript. All of the art and animation is made by me. There are no images incorporated on the page; all of the art is code based.

Links are broken, content is currently just a placeholder, and contact me is not functional nor does it include any real credentials.

I hope you enjoy :)
